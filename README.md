A karaoke player for Thai karaoke songs, written in Rust: NCN song packs
and its own `.sfkar` format, a SoundFont synth for the backing tracks, and
lyrics that light up syllable by syllable.

## The karaoke player

- **Lyric stage.** Lines fill with colour per syllable (Thai vowels and
  tone marks are shaped properly), in one of two layouts (`L`):
  *scroll*, where the line being sung sits in the middle and finished
  lines drift up, or *classic*, two fixed lines in the middle that take
  turns. A title card shows before the singing starts, four dots count
  in after a long rest, and the time of day sits in the corner with four
  dots beside it that count the beats of the bar like a metronome (1 2 3 4,
  following the song's tempo; taken as 4/4 from the start).
  The lyric colours (still to sing, sung, the wipe edge, outline) come
  from six presets or a colour picker each, the outline's thickness goes
  from none to four times the default, and the lyrics can use any
  `.ttf` / `.otf` / `.ttc` font (letters it lacks fall back to Noto Sans
  Thai).
- **Guide melody off** (`V`). Mutes MIDI channel 9, where NCN songs
  carry the vocal melody, in every song until turned back on.
- **Overlays.** Songs and queue share one panel over the stage (`/`,
  `Q`, `Tab` between them); all commands (`Ctrl K`), settings (`Ctrl ,`)
  and About open as popups of their own. Every popup and window can be
  dragged by its title bar (double-click it to put it back).
- **Settings.** Sections for the song library (folders, counts, rescan),
  audio output (device, volume, guide melody), lyrics (layout, size with
  a live sample, outline thickness, timing, clock, font, colours),
  shortcuts and the data files.
- **Context menus.** Right click the stage or the bottom bar for
  playback, key and tempo, every panel and full screen; right click a
  song, a queued song, a mixer strip, a SoundFont or a channel for what
  applies to it. Each entry shows its keyboard shortcut.
- **Full screen** (`F`, `F11` or double-click the stage) fills the screen
  and keeps everything: bottom bar, mixer, overlays and windows. Type to filter, arrows to move, Enter to
  act.
- **Backgrounds.** Any picture file (png, jpg, webp, bmp, gif), or a
  folder of pictures shown as a slideshow with a cross-fade; the app
  ships no pictures of its own. Settings › background sets how dark the
  picture is, how it fits the screen and a slow pan and zoom; `B` skips
  to the next picture of the slideshow. Both screens show it, and the
  mixer opens over it rather than pushing it up.
- **MIDI I/O.** Settings › audio picks the **MIDI Output**: the
  *Solfege Engine* (the built-in SoundFont synth) or any MIDI device: a
  keyboard, a sound module, or a synth on the computer (on Windows,
  "Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth"). For a device the player still keeps
  time; the key, mute / solo, the guide-melody switch and VOL (as GM
  Master Volume) still apply, GM / GS / XG resets and drum parts are
  passed on, and every note-off goes to the key its note-on went to.
  SoundFonts, faders and effects only shape the engine's own sound. A
  **MIDI Input** (a keyboard to play along) plays wherever the song plays,
  on its own channels or moved to one channel (16, for instance).
- **Second screen (dual display)** (`D`). A window of its own with only
  the lyrics, for a TV or projector, while the main window keeps the
  controls. Drag it onto the other display and press `F` (or double-click)
  for full screen there, or pick the display in Settings; it reopens in
  the same place, full screen if it was. The pointer hides on it after
  two seconds, and every shortcut works from it too.
- **Song catalogue.** Any number of NCN libraries and `.sfkar` folders in
  one searchable list, with favourites and play counts, kept in an SQLite
  database (`songs.dat`); songs can be queued. A folder of `.sfkar` files
  converted from an NCN library lists its own copies next to the NCN
  ones, each tagged NCN or SFKAR.
- **Native file dialogs.** SoundFonts and song folders are picked with
  the system's own dialog: the common item dialog on Windows, NSOpenPanel
  on macOS and the XDG desktop portal on Linux (the desktop's file chooser
  on Wayland or X11, `zenity` when no portal runs).
- **Key and tempo.** Change key by semitones (the drums stay put) and
  tempo from 50 % to 150 %; BPM and key are shown live.
- **Mixer.** Its own panel, docked under the lyrics: all 16 MIDI channels
  (channel 10 is the fader for the whole drum kit), each drum-kit piece,
  reverb and chorus returns and master, with gain, pan, mute, solo,
  reverb / chorus sends and meters. Strips keep a readable width; when
  they do not all fit, a scrollbar (or the mouse wheel) slides them
  sideways. Pan and sends start from the song's
  own values (MIDI CC 10, 91, 93) and your adjustment goes on top;
  double-click returns to the song's value. The reverb (room, damping,
  width) and chorus (rate, depth, delay) are adjustable on their return
  strips and remembered between runs.
- **Master effect chain.** Ten effect slots in a sidebar on the right of
  the mixer, run in order on the main output: EQ, compressor, limiter,
  delay, reverb, chorus, drive, filter and stereo width. Click a slot to
  edit it in a popup; each can be bypassed, moved or cleared (right
  click), and the chain is saved in `config.json`.
- **Sound settings window.** SoundFonts, channels, instruments and the
  drum kit have their own window (`S` or the bar button), separate from
  the command overlay.
- **SoundFont rack.** Up to eight SoundFonts (or SFZ instruments). Route
  each MIDI channel to any of them, pin a different sound on a channel,
  or choose the sound of any of the 128 General MIDI instruments, from
  any font, for whichever channel plays it.
- **Drum kit lock.** Lock channel 10 to one kit; songs cannot change it.
- **A kit per drum piece.** Kick, snare, hi-hat, toms, cymbals, cowbell
  and percussion can each play from a kit of their own, from any SoundFont;
  the pieces left alone play from channel 10's kit. Their mixer strips
  work the same either way.

### Keyboard

| Key | | Key | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Space` | play / pause | `/` | search songs |
| `Shift Space` | stop (back to the start) | | |
| `←` `→` | back / forward 5 s | `Q` | queue |
| `[` `]` | key down / up | `M` | mixer panel |
| `,` `.` | slower / faster | `S` | sound settings window |
| `V` | guide melody (channel 9) on / off | `L` | lyric layout |
| `N` | next song in the queue | `Ctrl K` | all commands |
| `F` / `F11` | full screen (`Esc` leaves) | `Ctrl ,` | settings |
| `D` | second screen on / off | `B` | next background picture (slideshow) |
| right click | context menu | | |

In the song / queue panel: `Enter` reserves a song, `Shift Enter` sings it
now, `Ctrl D` marks a favourite, `Tab` switches between songs and queue and
`Esc` closes; `Esc` closes any popup.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Rust **1.95** or newer (edition 2024), and a C compiler (SQLite is
  built from source by `rusqlite`).
- **Linux:** ALSA headers and `pkg-config` to build
  (`sudo apt install libasound2-dev pkg-config` on Debian / Ubuntu), and
  OpenGL plus `libxkbcommon-x11` to run. File dialogs need
  `xdg-desktop-portal` (any desktop has it) or, without one, `zenity`.
- **Windows:** nothing extra (audio goes through WASAPI).
- macOS is untested.
- Graphics go through **wgpu** (Vulkan, Metal or Direct3D 12, with
  OpenGL as a fallback), so any GPU from the last decade, or a software
  renderer such as llvmpipe, works.

### Songs and sounds

Neither songs nor SoundFonts are part of the repository.

- **Sample songs.** An NCN sample pack is used for development and tests.
  Unpack it into `shared/` so that `shared/NCN/Song`, `shared/NCN/Lyrics`
  and `shared/NCN/Cursor` exist:

  ```sh
  curl -LO https://cdn.futureboard.studio/NCN.zip
  unzip NCN.zip -d shared
  ```

- **SoundFont.** Any General MIDI `.sf2` works (for example the
  `timgm6mb-soundfont` or `fluid-soundfont-gm` packages on Debian /
  Ubuntu). The player looks in `shared/`, next to the executable and in
  `/usr/share/sounds/sf2`, or you can add one in the sound settings window.

### Run

```sh
cargo run --release -p karaoke                     # the karaoke player
cargo run --release -p karaoke -- Z2608001         # start a song by its code
cargo run --release -p karaoke -- song.sfkar       # play a .sfkar file directly
cargo run --release -p karaoke -- -s gm.sf2 -s piano.sfz -L /path/to/NCN
cargo run --release -p karaoke -- --help
```

Settings and the song catalogue are kept in the app's data folder
(`~/.local/share/solfege-karaoke` on Linux,
`%APPDATA%\solfege-karaoke\data` on Windows; both paths are also shown
under Settings):

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | Settings as readable JSON: SoundFont rack and routing, sounds per instrument, drum kit lock, reverb / chorus, audio device, MIDI output and input, background, lyric size, offset, outline, colours and font, the second screen's place. Edit it while the player is closed; missing fields take their defaults. `--config <FILE>` uses another file. |
| `songs.dat` | The song catalogue, an SQLite database: song folders, songs, favourites and play history. |

Settings and catalogues of older versions (eframe's `app.ron`,
`songs.json`) are imported on the first start.

### Convert NCN to `.sfkar`

```sh
cargo run --release -p ncn2sfkar -- shared/NCN                 # all songs -> shared/NCN-sfkar/
cargo run --release -p ncn2sfkar -- shared/NCN -o out Z2608001 # some songs
cargo run --release -p ncn2sfkar -- shared/NCN --dry-run       # check only
```

Existing files are kept unless `--force` is given; the exit code is
non-zero if any song failed.

## The `.sfkar` format

One file per song, so a song no longer needs three parallel folders and
its text is UTF-8 instead of Windows-874:

```text
"SFKR"  u16 version (1)  u16 flags (0)
chunks: 4-byte id, u32 length (little endian), data
  META  JSON: title, artist, key, source id, duration
  MIDI  a Standard MIDI File (the backing track)
  LYRC  JSON: lines of [tick, text] segments with an end tick
```

Lyric times are ticks of the MIDI chunk, so they follow its tempo map and
any playback speed. Readers skip chunks they do not know. The full
description is in [`crates/solfege_sfkar`](crates/solfege_sfkar/src/lib.rs).
As the project is experimental, the format may still change.

## Development

```sh
cargo test --workspace      # needs shared/NCN; a few tests also use a .sf2
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```
